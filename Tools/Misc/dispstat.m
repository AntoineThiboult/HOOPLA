function dispstat(TXT,varargin)
% 
% dispstat(TXT,varargin)
%
% Prints overwritable message to the command line. If you dont want to keep
% this message, call dispstat function with option 'keepthis'. If you want to
% keep the previous message, use option 'keepprev'. First argument must be
% the message.
% IMPORTANT! In the firt call, option 'init' must be used for initialization purposes.
% Options:
%     'init'      this must be called in the begining. Otherwise, it can overwrite the previous outputs on the command line.
%     'keepthis'    the message will be persistent, wont be overwritable,
%     'keepprev'  the previous message wont be overwritten. New message will start from next line,
%     'timestamp' current time hh:mm:ss will be appended to the begining of the message.
% Example:
%   clc;
%   fprintf('12345677890\n');
%   dispstat('','init')      %Initialization. Does not print anything.
%   dispstat('Time stamp will be written over this text.'); % First output
%   dispstat('is current time.','timestamp','keepthis'); % Overwrites the previous output but this output wont be overwritten.
%   dispstat(sprintf('*********\nDeveloped by %s\n*********','Kasim')); % does not overwrites the previous output
%   dispstat('','timestamp','keepprev','keepthis'); % does not overwrites the previous output
%   dispstat('this wont be overwriten','keepthis');
%   dispstat('dummy dummy dummy');
%   dispstat('final stat');
% % Output:
%     12345677890
%     15:15:34 is current time.
%     *********
