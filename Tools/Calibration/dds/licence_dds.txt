This DDS algorithm implementation is free for public use and you are free to redistribute it.  
However, the user needs to reference the use of this program in any papers/reports/articles 
which have results obtained from the use of this program.  I would also appreciate a copy of 
such papers/articles/reports, or at least an e-mail message with the reference so I can get

Please report to me any bugs you find in this code.

For companies wishing to link this optimization code with an existing simulation model 
generating objective/constraint values, I am available for some consulting work.  I suggest 
users alter this code as little as possible to make future updates I make to DDS easier to 
incorporate.
